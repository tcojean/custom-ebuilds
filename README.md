Custom Ebuilds
-------------

This repo contains a few ebuilds I often use. There no is guarantee that they will always be up to date or 100% working.

Currently this contains:
+ [qubes-pass](https://github.com/Rudd-O/qubes-pass)
+ [xst](https://github.com/gnotclub/xst)
+ [cmake-language-server](https://github.com/regen100/cmake-language-server)
+ [pygls](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls) dependency of cmake-language-server
